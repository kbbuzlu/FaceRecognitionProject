# FaceRecognitionProject

age_gender_detection.py needs age_deploy.prototxt, age_net.caffemodel, gender_deploy.prototxt, gender_net.caffemodel, opencv_face_detector.pbtxt, opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb files.

I don't use this module in my GUI project. Deep Face Library better works. 

Since I couldn't find the right code to turn off the camera, I just added an exit button so that the program wouldn't crash.

The program works fine.
It would be even better if the train file was expanded.

I mainly used DeepFace,face_recognition,OpenCv libraries.
